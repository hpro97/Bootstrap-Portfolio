# challenge_2_portfolio_harry_probert


## Description 

i built this project to have a fully funcitonal place to display my front end coding work, i implemented bootstrap elements for this project to build upon an existing project without any bootstrap, i implemented self built CSS on top of bootstrap to give the project more individualilty whilst keeping it to a minimum as to retain the bootstrap layout. I created a bootstrap navbar with funtional links correlating to a bootstrap grid system to display my portoflio of work, using placeholders for future projects, i checked for full functionality across different screen sizes and corrected anything by adding bootstrap classes as to minimie media queries. I added comments in both the HTML and CSS files to improve structure making the view more intuitive. The reason for this project was to elaborate on an existing portfolio and recreate it with boootstrap elements as to give a more user friendly and professional feel. All whilst giving me a place to display my work.
